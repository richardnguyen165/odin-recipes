        <h2 class="font">Description</h2>
            <p class="font">Fresh orange juice takes a little work, but it tastes much better than orange juice from concentrate. I came up with this recipe in response to a request about how to make fresh-squeezed orange juice. You may also use a citrus reamer to do this. If you want less pulp, use a hand juicer with a strainer.</p>

                <li class="font">4 oranges</li>
